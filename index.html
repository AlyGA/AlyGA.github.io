            Hi there! My name is Aly. I am a full-stack developer in California.
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ever since I was a kid I enjoyed programming, especially when I used
            to play games like Minecraft and found out how to modify it to my
            pleasure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I started taking programming seriously in my freshman year of High
            School when I signed up for my first Introduction to Computer
            Science, which happened to be a college course. It was the first
            time I really learned about C++ and truly loved it. After that, I
            went to a summer camp for coding hosted at Stanford College and
            created my very first game written fully in Java.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thanks to the fun experiences in both my childhood and summer camp
            experiences, I decided to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science. From my time studying in college, I decided that being a
            full-stack developer would be my goal in starting my career. Since
            then, I have been polishing my skills in Javascript and have made
            some very fun projects. I have discovered too, that I love designing
            and creating websites, so I have been refining my HTML and CSS
            knowledge as well. I hope to help any company achieve their goal for
            better user-experience and creating safer programs.
