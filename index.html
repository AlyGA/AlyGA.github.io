            Hi there! My name is Aly. I am a full-stack developer in California.
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ever since I was a kid I enjoyed programming, especially when I used
            to play games like Minecraft and found out how to modify it to my
            pleasure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I started taking programming seriously in my freshman year of High
            School when I signed up for my first Introduction to Computer
            Science, which happened to be a college course. It was the first
            time I really learned about C++ and truly loved it. After that, I
            went to a summer camp for coding hosted at Stanford College and
            created my very first game written fully in Java.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thanks to the fun experiences in both my childhood and summer camp
            experiences, I decided to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science. From my time studying in college, I decided that being a
            full-stack developer would be my goal in starting my career. Since
            then, I have been polishing my skills in Javascript and have made
            some very fun projects. I have discovered too, that I love designing
            and creating websites, so I have been refining my HTML and CSS
            knowledge as well. I hope to help any company achieve their goal for
            better user-experience and creating safer programs.

              <p>C++ was a very difficult for me to learn because it was very different from the works of Java or Javascript--languages that I was used to. I tried applying my skills by making a class roster from a prexisting list. This list displays my abilities to manipulate and parse data. Because this is mostly backend, I have yet to display this on a live website; however, an exe file is included in the Github for live viewing purposes.</p>

              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>This project scenario was designed from an idea from my school. The goal for this application is to locate each package's desired destination and come up with the fastest route for it to be delivered. Once it has been delivered, it will indicate it by showing a "delivered" status. The user can enter any date they would like to check a package's status.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This project is backend and is not displayed on a website. Therefore, it must be downloaded to recieve a live preview. The location for downloading is listed below.</p>
