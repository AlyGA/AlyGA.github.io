# UI Design

This github pages repository holds my portfolio, the things that I've done, and how to contact me. The UI design idea was created by myself and taken inspiration from multiple different sites. In order to implement the designs I desired, I went through multiple tutorials and documents to achieve this. This is my **third idea** for a portfolio. It will promote more responsiveness and a mobile-friendly implementation may be added in the future.

This was designed in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No libraries, as of yet, were used in the process. Although, this may change in the future.
