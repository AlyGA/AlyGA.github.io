## Portfolio Website 2

# UI Design

This github pages repository holds my portfolio, the things that I've done, and how to contact me. The UI design idea was created by myself and taken inspiration from multiple parallax scrolling websites. In order to implement the designs I desired, I went through multiple tutorials and documents to achieve this. This is my **second idea** for a portfolio.

This was designed in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No libraries, as of yet, were used in the process. Although, this may change in the future.

The table below is the desired features that have yet to be implemented by myself. "In-Progress" means that I am in the process of having this feature completed, while "Not Completed" indicates that I have not started, but may do so in the future:

| Features                                                   |    Status     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: |
| Find a design that stipulates a feminine style             | Not Completed |
| Search Color Schemes                                       | Not Completed |
| Design Header that introduces your name                    | Not Completed |
| Design About Me Section                                    | Not Completed |
| Design Projects, which should be below header and about me | Not Completed |
| Design Contact section                                     | Not Completed |
| Design Footer that should blend with color themes          | Not Completed |
