## My Portfolio Website Plans

# UI Design

This github pages repository holds my portfolio, the things that I've done, and how to contact me. The UI design idea was created by myself and taken inspiration from multiple parallax scrolling websites. In order to implement the designs I desired, I went through multiple tutorials and documents to achieve this. A majority of the tutorials that I watched were from the YouTube channel "Online Tutorials".

This was designed in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No libraries, as of yet, were used in the process. Although, this may change in the future.

The table below is the desired features that have yet to be implemented by myself. "In-Progress" means that I am in the process of having this feature completed, while "Not Completed" indicates that I have not started, but may do so in the future:

| Features                                              |    Status     |
